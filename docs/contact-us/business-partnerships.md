## Farms and Syrup Pools

Farms incentivize users to provide liquidity for your trading pair by distributing LAT to your pair's LP Token holders.

Syrup Pools are a way of distributing your tokens to PlatON users who stake LAT in the pool.

These two products go hand-in-paw on PancakeSwap: when a project provides their tokens for a Syrup Pool, we'll also create a Farm. If you're looking to distribute tokens and incentivize liquidity, get in touch.

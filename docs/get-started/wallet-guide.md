## **Desktop/Web Browser wallets**

Desktop wallets are available on your home computer or laptop computer. Wallets on your computer can run as standalone applications, or as web browser plugins for popular browsers like Chrome and Firefox.

### Which desktop wallet should I choose?

Currently only MetaMask is recommended

:::danger
NEVER, in any situation, should you ever give someone your private key or recovery phrase ("seed phrase"). This will give someone complete access to your crypto!

The genuine DipoleSwap site and staff will never ask you to input your seed phrase.

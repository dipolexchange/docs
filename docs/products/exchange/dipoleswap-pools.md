When you add your token to a Liquidity Pool you will receive Liquidity Provider (LP) tokens and share in the fees.


## LP Tokens

As an example, if you deposited **GT** and **LAT** into a Liquidity Pool, you'd receive **GT-LAT LP** tokens.
The number of LP tokens you receive represents your portion of the GT-LAT Liquidity Pool.
You can also redeem your funds at any time by removing your liquidity.

## Liquidity Providers earn trading fees

Providing liquidity gives you a reward in the form of trading fees when people use your liquidity pool.

Whenever someone trades on DipoleSwap, the trader pays a 0.25% fee, all of which 0.25% is added to the Liquidity Pool of the swap pair they traded on.

For example:

+ There are 10 LP tokens representing 10 LAT and 10 GT tokens.

+ 1 LP token = 1 LAT + 1 GT
  
+ Someone trades 10 GT for 10 LAT.

+ Someone else trades 10 LAT for 10 GT.

+ The GT/LAT liquidity pool now has 10.025 GT and 10.025 LAT.

+ Each LP token is now worth 1.0025 GT + 1.0025 LAT.

To make being a liquidity provider even more worth your while, you can also put your LP tokens to work whipping up some fresh yield on the <font color='#009fae'>LAT Farms</font>, while still earning your 0.25% trading fee reward.

## Impermanent Loss

Providing liquidity is not without risk, as you may be exposed to impermanent loss.

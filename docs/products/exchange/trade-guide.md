Trading on DipoleSwap is very easy compared to most exchanges. You aren't going to be overwhelmed by charts or jargon, and calculations are all handled for you.

## Getting set up to trade

Before you can trade, you will need a PlatON Network-compatible wallet. You can learn how to get one [here](/docs/get-started/wallet-guide). You will also need to have some PRC20 tokens to trade with. You can learn how to get some [here](/docs/get-started/prc20-guide).

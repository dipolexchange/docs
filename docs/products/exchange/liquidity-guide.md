"Liquidity" is central to how DipoleSwap's Exchange works. You can add liquidity for any token pair by staking both through the Liquidity page.
In return for adding liquidity, you'll receive trading fees for that pair, and receive LP Tokens you can stake in Farms to earn LAT rewards!

## Adding liquidity

To provide liquidity, you’ll need to commit an amount of any token pair you like. Your lowest value (in USD) of the two tokens will be the limit to the liquidity you can provide.
You can easily trade for any tokens you need. Visit our [How to Trade on DipoleSwap guide](/docs/products/exchange/trade-guide) if you need to.
In this example, we will add liquidity using LAT and GT.

1. Visit the Liquidity page.

(If one of the token does not have enough balance. You will see an error and the button being greyed out. Please enter a lower amount to proceed.)

6. Click the Enable GT button. If you are adding liquidity against tokens other than LAT, you might need to click enable twice for each token in your pair. Your wallet will ask you to confirm the action.

# How to Stake in Syrup Pools

Staking in [Syrup Pools](https://dipolexchange.github.io/doc/products/syrup-pool) lets you earn LAT or other tokens while you sleep!

It's simpler than farming with DipoleSwap's Yield Farms because unlike the Farms, you only need to stake **one token** to start earning: usually LAT.

## **Getting started with Syrup Pool staking**

1\. Go to the Pools page [here](https://dipoleswap.exchange/pools).

Syrup Pools let you stake your LAT to earn other tokens. Make sure you check them out.

8\. Click **Confirm**. Your wallet will ask you to confirm the action.

9\. The Confirm button will change to "Confirming", then once the transaction is successful, you’ll see your staked amount change and the button will change again.

10\. You should now be able to see details on your Syrup Pool.

### **Adding and removing LAT from a pool**

You can easily add more LAT to a Syrup Pool, or move some LAT to a more profitable pool. Here’s how you can move your staked LAT.

1\. Click the **-** to take some LAT out of a pool, or the **+** to add more to the pool.

2\. A window will open. If you clicked the **+**, choose the amount you would like to add to the pool. If you clicked the **-**, choose the amount to take out of the pool.

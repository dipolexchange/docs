## How can I stake LAT?

You can stake your LAT in DipoleSwap Syrup Pools. Visit the [Syrup Pools page](https://dipoleswap.exchange/pools).

Read our [How to Stake in Syrup Pools guide](https://dipolexchange.github.io/docs/products/syrup-pool/syrup-pool-guide) if you'd like a hand getting started with staking.

## What is the difference between staking and farming?

Staking in Syrup Pools and farming with Yield Farming are both ways to earn more LAT by supporting DipoleSwap.

Staking only needs some LAT to be added to a Syrup Pool to earn other tokens.

Farming is more complicated and needs LP Tokens to earn LAT.

## How do I farm?

We have a [Yield Farming guide](https://dipolexchange.github.io/docs/products/farm-guide) if you're interested in learning how to farm.

## Where can I view the DipoleSwap roadmap?

You can [view our to-do list here, but don't call it a roadmap](https://dipolexchange.github.io/docs/roadmap).

## How do I connect my wallet to PlatON Network and DipoleSwap?

We have a [Connect Your Wallet to DipoleSwap guide](https://dipolexchange.github.io/docs/get-started/connection-guide) covering this in detail.

## What's the best wallet for DipoleSwap?

It depends on your needs. We have an [in-depth guide to selecting and creating a wallet](https://dipolexchange.github.io/docs/get-started/wallet-guide) that's right for you.

## Why is my transaction failing?

You can check the status of a transaction on [https://scan.platon.network](https://scan.platon.network).

Our [Troubleshooting Errors guide](https://dipolexchange.github.io/docs/help/troubleshooting) may have a solution for your problem if you're having issues.

## When will you open more pools?

New Pools are added to DipoleSwap frequently. There will always be an announcement before the launch of new pools.

Join the announcements Telegram group to learn about new Pools as early as possible.

## Did Farm APR calculation change?

Previously, rewards earned by LP Token-holders generated from trading fees were not included in Farm APR calculations. APR calculations now include these rewards, and better reflect the expected APR for Farm pairs.

## How can I report a bug?

Learn about our [bug bounty and potential bounty payouts](https://dipolexchange.github.io/docs/developers/bug-bounty).

## Where can I view smart contracts?

Learn how to find smart contracts on our [Finding Contracts page](https://dipolexchange.github.io/docs/developers/smart-contracts/factory).

## Why does it say I have no LAT balance?

If you've already [transferred LAT into your PlatON wallet](https://dipolexchange.github.io/docs/get-started/prc20-guide) but still have this error, you're most likely not [connected to PlatON Network](https://dipolexchange.github.io/docs/get-started/connection-guide) within your wallet. Check your wallet's selected network and make sure you have PlatON Network selected.
